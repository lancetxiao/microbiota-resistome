##  Dissemination of the pathogen adjusted for antibiotic resistance

Something about a model.
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
\newpage
```{r plot1, echo=FALSE}
# plot.col <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#33a02c")
# number_of_people(abund.log,0,350, save = F, inp.title = "Shigella", col.pal = plot.col)
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder,"/tmp/plot1.pdf", sep=""))
```
\newpage
```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
#dev.new(width=5, height=10)
#number_of_people_area_plot(abund.log, inp.title="Shigella", plot.col)
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder,"/tmp/plot2.pdf", sep=""))
```
\newpage
```{r plot3, echo=FALSE}
# col.pall <- c("#a6cee3","#1f78b4","#b2df8a","#33a02c","#fb9a99","#fb6a4a","#fdbf6f","#ff7f00","#cab2d6","#6a3d9a","#ffd92f","#fc4e2a")#c("#1f78b4","#C54E6D", "#009380","#ff7f00")
# trans_line_plot(trans.summary.2ver, col.p = col.pall, note.t = trans.note, inp.title = "Shigella")
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder,"/tmp/plot3.pdf", sep=""))
```
\newpage
```{r plot4, echo=FALSE}
### area plot
# trans_number_area_plot(trans.summary.2ver, "Shigella", col.pall, note.t = trans.note)
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder,"/tmp/plot4.pdf", sep=""))
# by this way we can run .Rmd 
# rmarkdown::render("reportGenerating.Rmd")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
